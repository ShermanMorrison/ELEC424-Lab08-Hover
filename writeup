Lab07: PID tuning
Jonathan Wilson, Chase Stewart


Final PID values:
<PID values>

Changes to Code:


Approach to tuning the PID:

We started with pitch_kp at 50, roll_kp at 60, yaw_kp at 70, and all ki and kd gains at 0. We then determined the pitch_kp that gave the minimum error, holding the other gains constant. We repeated this process for roll_kp and yaw_kp, using the optimal kp's already calculated.
To set the ki and kd, we did some <CHASE MAGIC>.

<What interface does the controller signal use to determine motor thrust?>
